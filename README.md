# CBW-Esports-Discord-Bot
The Discord Bot for the CBW Esports Club
Created by Marshall Miller

This Bot functions as the server moderator and runs on a node.js platform. Utilizing the discord.js and Google Spreadsheets API, the bot reads submitted club member information from the spreadsheet and adds their corresponding roles, otherwise kicking the member from the server.
